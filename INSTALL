Installation Instructions.

First of all, you must have a web server installed and it must support 
PHP.  It is beyond the scope of these instructions to tell you how to 
do this. 

The web server has a directory that it considers the top level of the 
document tree.  What you need to do is copy the four php files and one 
css file to a directory somewhere in this tree.  It is suggested you 
create a directory in this tree just for BoincPHP-GUI and then copy the 
files to that directory.  

For example, let's say the directory your web server considers the top 
of the document tree is /home/www/html and you create a directory there 
called boincphpgui and copy the files to it.  Furthermore, let's say 
your web server is at http://www.example.com.  You would then go to 
http://www.example.com/boincphpgui/index.php to access the application.

Please also read the file names SECURITY.  If you don't, it might be 
possible for someone to access your web server, detach all your project 
and attach all of their own.  You don't want to be running someone 
else's workunits, do you?  I didn't think so.
