Security Considerations.

If you only install the files as described in the installation 
instructions, it might be possible for someone to access BoincPHP-GUI 
on your web server, detach your projects and attach their own projects. 
 The way I suggest you protect against this is to require a user name 
and password in order to access the application.   (Of course, if your 
web server is not accessible from the Internet, this may be a moot 
point.)

I know how to do this on the Apache web server.  I am not familiar with 
other web servers.  You do this by configuring the web server to look 
for a particular file in any directory.  If the file exists, it 
contains information that causes the web server to prompt the user for 
a name and password.

This is a snippet from a typical config file for apache:

#
# AccessFileName: The name of the file to look for in each directory
# for access control information.  See also the AllowOverride directive.
#
AccessFileName .htaccess

#
# The following lines prevent .htaccess and .htpasswd files from being
# viewed by Web clients.
#
<Files ~ "^\.ht">
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
</Files>

The contents of a typical .htaccess file might look like this:

<Files *>
        AuthName "Boinc"
        AuthType Basic
        AuthUserFile /path/to/htpasswd
        require valid-user
</Files>

The htpasswd file contains username password pairs.  The passwords are 
encrypted.  Typically on Linux systems the htpasswd file is created 
with the htpasswd command.  

If you know how to do something similar on other platforms or have a 
better idea, please send them to dennett@rochester.rr.com and they will 
be included in future releases.
